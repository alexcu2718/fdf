         Smart end-of-stream detection: Avoid unnecessary system calls by detecting when
         we've likely exhausted the directory based on the returned byte count.

         Why this works:
         - A full directory read returns exactly buffer.max_capacity() bytes
         - A partial read (end approaching) returns less than maximum
         - If returned bytes ≤ (max_capacity - largest_dirent_size), the file descriptor is exhausted
         - Meaning that the next system call will return 0 anyway.

         Example:
         - Buffer capacity: 4600 bytes (It is arbitrary)
         - Largest dirent64 size: 280 bytes
         - If getdents returns ≤ 4320 bytes (4600 - 280), then even if we made another
           system call, it would definitively call 0 bytes on next call, so we skip it!
           Through this optimisation, we can truly 1 shot small directories, as well as remove number of getdents calls down by 50%! (rough tests)

             Determines the file type of a directory entry with fallback resolution.

             This method attempts to determine the file type using the directory entry's
             `d_type` field when available, with a fallback to fstat-based resolution
             when the type is unknown or unsupported by the filesystem.

             # Arguments
             * `d_type` - The file type byte from the directory entry's `d_type` field;
               This corresponds to DT_* constants in libc (e.g., `DT_REG`, `DT_DIR`).
             * `filename` - The filename as a C string, used for fallback stat resolution
               when `d_type` is `DT_UNKNOWN`

             # Returns
             A `FileType` enum variant representing the determined file type.

             # Behavior
             - **Fast Path**: When `d_type` contains a known file type (not `DT_UNKNOWN`),
               returns the corresponding `FileType` without additional system calls.
             - **Fallback Path**: When `d_type` is `DT_UNKNOWN`, performs a `fstat` call
               on the file to determine its actual type.
             - **Symlink Handling**: For `DT_LNK`, returns `FileType::Symlink` directly
               without following the link.

             # Performance Notes
             - Prefer using directory entries with supported `d_type` to avoid stat calls
             - The fallback stat call adds filesystem overhead but ensures correctness
             - Some filesystems (e.g., older XFS, NTFS) may return `DT_UNKNOWN`
